Contents in this data folder are in csv format from the EPA website (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data) for daily AQI data. The website has a query where I selected State = 'California', Pollutant = 'PM2.5', and with all testing sites in the state. I noticed that the EPA website's API for downloading the raw daily data was not as accurate and did not report the daily data only in intervals of 3 days.

Simply download the file folder and its contents under your working directory.
